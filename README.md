# Darkroom

This is a general container for small appliances I'm building for my analog darkroom acrtivities. 

Currently just an exposure timer, there might be some sort of chemical agitation device in the future, for film and paper treatment.

You are welcome to use it, though the HW is still largely undocumented. It's currently undergoing a first round of HW testing.
